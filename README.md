# Direct Message

This is a simple skill that is used to directly reach out and message
the owner of an avatar you know.

It's current motivation is to check that the network is well connected
and that messages are being replicated correctly.

## TODO
If we want this to be developed further we will need:

1. Rate Limiting
2. Encryption
3. Friendly Name Mapping
